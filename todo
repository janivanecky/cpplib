====================
DOING
====================
- reduce depenencies between libs (mainly maths.h, memory.h, stack.h, array.h...)

====================
TODO
====================
- headers only
- graphics.cpp - init - when minor objects failed to create, should we continue? should we deallocate and quit?
- resources.cpp - better error handling
- retrospectively update apps - Physarum/Boids/Turing etc.
- remove less useful libs - logging/array?
- move "exotic" modules to separate folder
- fix brace scopes format

====================
DONE
====================

- graphics.cpp - when exiting because of error, release allocated resources
- logging is just a bunch of macros instead of .h + .cpp

20/05/2019
- use logging only when it provides additional info and CPPLIB_DEBUG_PRINT defined

19/05/2019
- Remove logging from platform.cpp
- Re-run and fixed libs not used in a while
- math2.h -> maths.h
- audio lib returns errors + logging only if CPPLIB_DEBUG_PRINT defined
